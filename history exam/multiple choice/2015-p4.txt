There is one essential point wherein a political
liar differs from others of the faculty; that he ought to
have but a short memory, which is necessary
according to the various occasions he meets with
every hour, of differing from himself and swearing to
both sides of a contradiction, as he finds the persons
disposed, with whom he has to deal. In describing the
virtues and vices of mankind, it is convenient, upon
every article, to have some eminent person in our eye,
from whom we copy our description. I have strictly
observed this rule; and my imagination this minute
represents before me a certain great man famous for
this talent, to the constant practice of which he owes
his twenty years’ reputation of the most skilful head
in England, for the management of nice affairs. The
superiority of his genius consists in nothing else but
an inexhaustible fund of political lies, which he
plentifully distributes every minute he speaks, and by
an unparalleled generosity forgets, and consequently
contradicts the next half hour. He never yet
considered whether any proposition were true or false,
but whether it were convenient for the present minute
or company to affirm or deny it; so that if you think
fit to refine upon him by interpreting everything he
says, as we do dreams, by the contrary, you are still
to seek, and will find yourself equally deceived
whether you believe or no: the only remedy is to
suppose that you have heard some inarticulate sounds,
without any meaning at all. And besides, that will take
off the horror you might be apt to conceive at the
oaths wherewith he perpetually tags both ends of
every proposition: though at the same time I think he
cannot with any justice be taxed with perjury, when
he invokes God and Christ, because he has often
fairly given public notice to the world, that he
believes in neither.
Some people may think that such an
accomplishment as this, can be of no great use to the
owner or his party, after it has been often practised,
and is become notorious; but they are widely
mistaken: Few lies carry the inventor’s mark, and the
most prostitute enemy to truth may spread a thousand
without being known for the author. Besides, as the
vilest writer has his readers, so the greatest liar has
his believers; and it often happens, that if a lie be
believed only for an hour, it has done its work, and
there is no farther occasion for it. Falsehood flies, and
truth comes limping after it; so that when men come
to be undeceived, it is too late, the jest is over, and the
tale has had its effect: like a man who has thought of a
good repartee when the discourse is changed or the
company parted: or, like a physician who has found
out an infallible medicine, after the patient is dead.
Considering that natural disposition in many men
to lie, and in multitudes to believe, I have been
perplexed what to do with that maxim so frequent in
everybody’s mouth, that “Truth will at last prevail.”
Here has this island* of ours, for the greatest part of
twenty years, lain under the influence of such
counsels and persons, whose principle and interest it
was to corrupt our manners, blind our understanding,
drain our wealth, and in time destroy our constitution
both in Church and State; and we at last were brought
to the very brink of ruin; yet, by the means of
perpetual misrepresentations, have never been able to
distinguish between our enemies and friends.
