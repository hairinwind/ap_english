There is something preemptive about laziness,
something that smacks of a decision to refuse all
offers even before they’re put on the table. The lazy
don’t come to the table. And I think there is a
philosophical component to this reluctance. At
bottom, laziness is negation, turning one’s back on
what others neutrally, cheerfully, or resignedly go to
meet. The truly lazy—the ones who cannot bring
themselves to greet and meet, to scheme and struggle,
to interact on a daily basis with others—are, in effect,
refusing to affix their signatures to the social contract.
Given that success hinges on understanding, using,
and occasionally subverting the social contract, the
lazy don’t stand a chance.
The secret to failure is far more elusive than the
secret to success. Lagging behind when one could
have advanced isn’t just about laziness; it’s about all
the things that psychoanalysis takes a rather serious
view of—the absence of love, coping with anger,
rationalizing failure, the reluctance to supersede or
replace one’s father. Heavy stuff, and perhaps true,
but the acknowledgment of which never put a dime in
my pocket.
Laziness just is. It’s like being freckled or color
blind. Indeed, when the world was younger,
intelligent people believed they had no choice in the
matter of who was naughty or nice, passive or active.
Hippocrates’s theory1 of “temperament,” which
anchored Western medicine for two millennia, put
some muscle behind varieties of human behavior.
Well, not muscle exactly—more like four potentially
pathogenic substances, or cardinal humors, whose
relative proportion in the blood determined
personality and moods. The Church fathers, as it turns
out, were on the right track; only the messenger and
manner of delivery were wrong. It’s not black bile or
phlegm that causes Oblomov-like2 symptoms but a
certain kind of electrochemical activity in the left
frontal lobe of the brain, or whatever. The point is,
everyone enters the world predisposed physiologically
to think and feel in certain ways.
Happenstance also has its place; I don’t deny that.
But do any two people react identically to the same
stimuli? The event that jump-starts one person’s
psyche does not necessarily have the same effect on
another’s. It’s one thing to concede that certain
tendencies can be reinforced or weakened by
experience; it is quite another to think that some
event during my formative years, which might have
occurred but didn’t, would have had me sharing a
bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken with Bill Gates,
or loping down a runway in Milan wearing a spiffy
outfit by Valentino. In short, there’s no contradiction
in thinking that temperament defines you and thinking
that you’re still in charge of your life. Temperament is
the gas, but you’ve got a foot on the pedal.
Because of some unpredictable sequence of
recombinant DNA and early experiences, I always
knew I’d write things. I also knew I was an incurable
lazybones. This accounts, in my case, for the odd
tension between writing and laziness, which
Samuel Beckett describes to a T: “There is nothing to
express, nothing with which to express, nothing from
which to express, no power to express, no desire to
express, together with the obligation to express.” As a
solid constituent of the couchant3 class, I can say that
the obligation to express does not weigh heavily. Still,
I have my moments—moments when I feel like
addressing the fading shimmer of my own skin.
I want answers. Or, more precisely, one big answer.
In a sense, life is like an examination that has only
one question—the one that asks why you’re taking
the exam in the first place. Having been instructed to
“fill in the blank” (an aptly phrased command), you
ponder, and then wonder if perhaps the truest answer
is no answer at all. But in the end, because there is,
after all, plenty of time to reflect and you do want to
leave the room, you hunker down and fill in the blank.
My own response is hardly profound or incisive: I’m
taking the exam because I like writing sentences, and
because—well, what else do I have to do?
As for the laziness that moves with me wherever
I go, I have finally found a way to make it “work”
for me. Lassitude, aloofness, low-grade depression,
coupled with a healthy respect for money, have
gradually steered me to the obvious vocation.
Yes, dear reader, I have become a screenwriter.
