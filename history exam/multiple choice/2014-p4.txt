Such is the emptiness of human enjoyment, that
we are always impatient of the present. Attainment
is followed by neglect, and possession by disgust;
and the malicious remark of the Greek epigrammatist
on marriage may be applied to every other course of
life, that its two days of happiness are the first and the
last1.
Few moments are more pleasing than those in
which the mind is concerting measures for a new
undertaking. From the first hint that wakens the fancy,
till the hour of actual execution, all is improvement
and progress, triumph and felicity. Every hour brings
additions to the original scheme, suggests some new
expedient to secure success, or discovers consequential advantages not hitherto foreseen. While
preparations are made, and materials accumulated,
day glides after day through elysian prospects, and
the heart dances to the song of hope.
Such is the pleasure of projecting, that many
content themselves with a succession of visionary
schemes, and wear out their allotted time in the calm
amusement of contriving what they never attempt or
hope to execute.
Others, not able to feast their imagination with
pure ideas, advance somewhat nearer to the grossness
of action, with great diligence collect whatever is
requisite to their design, and, after a thousand
researches and consultations, are snatched away by
death, as they stand in procinctu2 waiting for a proper
opportunity to begin.
If there were no other end of life, than to find some
adequate solace for every day, I know not whether
any condition could be preferred to that of the man
who involves himself in his own thoughts, and never
suffers experience to show him the vanity of speculation; for no sooner are notions reduced to practice,
than tranquility and confidence forsake the breast;
every day brings its task, and often without bringing
abilities to perform it: difficulties embarrass,
uncertainty perplexes, opposition retards, censure
exasperates, or neglect depresses. We proceed,
because we have begun; we complete our design,
that the labor already spent may not be vain: but
as expectation gradually dies away, the gay smile
of alacrity disappears, we are compelled to implore
severer powers, and trust the event3 to patience and
constancy.
