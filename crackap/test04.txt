My own sex, I hope, will excuse me, if I treat
them like rational creatures, instead of flattering their
fascinating graces, and viewing them as if they were in
Line a state of perpetual childhood, unable to stand alone.
(5) Tearnestly wish to point out in what true dignity
and human happiness consists—I wish to persuade
women to endeavour to acquire strength, both of
mind and body, and to convince them that the soft
phrases, susceptibility of heart, delicacy of sentiment,
(10) and refinement of taste, are almost synonymous with
epithets of weakness, and that those beings who are
only the objects of pity and that kind of love, which
has been termed its sister, will soon become objects of
contempt.
(15) Dismissing then those pretty feminine phrases,
which the men condescendingly use to soften our
slavish dependence, and despising that weak elegancy
of mind, exquisite sensibility, and sweet docility of
manners, supposed to be the sexual characteristics
(20) of the weaker vessel, I wish to show that elegance
is inferior to virtue, that the first object of laudable
ambition is to obtain a character as a human being,
regardless of the distinction of sex; and that secondary
views should be brought to this simple touchstone.
(25) This is a rough sketch of my plan; and should I
express my conviction with the energetic emotions
that I feel whenever I think of the subject, the dictates
of experience and reflection will be felt by some of
my readers. Animated by this important object, I
(30) shall disdain to cull my phrases or polish my style-—I
aim at being useful, and sincerity will render me
unaffected; for, wishing rather to persuade by the
force of my arguments, than dazzle by the elegance of
my language, I shall not waste my time in rounding
(35) periods, nor in fabricating the turgid bombast of
artificial feelings, which, coming from the head, never
reach the heart—I shall be employed about things,
not words!—and, anxious to render my sex more
respectable to members of society, I shall try to avoid
(40) that flowery diction which has slided from essays
into novels, and from novels into familiar letters and
conversation.
These pretty nothings—these caricatures of the real
beauty of sensibility, dropping glibly from the tongue,
(45) vitiate the taste, and create a kind of sickly delicacy that
turns away from simple unadorned truth; and a deluge
of false sentiments and overstretched feelings, stifling
the natural emotions of the heart, render the domestic
pleasures insipid, that ought to sweeten the exercise
(50) of those severe duties, which educate a rational and
immortal being for a nobler field of action.
The education of women has, of late, been more
attended to than formerly; yet they are still reckoned
a frivolous sex, and ridiculed or pitied by the writers
(55) who endeavour by satire or instruction to improve
them. It is acknowledged that they spend many of the
first years of their lives in acquiring a smattering of
accomplishments: meanwhile strength of body and
mind are sacrificed to libertine notions of beauty, to
(60) the desire of establishing themselves—the only way
women can rise in the world—by marriage. And this
desire making mere animals of them, when they marry
they act as such children may be expected to act—they
dress; they paint, and nickname God’s creatures—
(65) Surely these weak beings are only fit for a seraglio!—
Can they govern a family, or take care of the poor
babes whom they bring into the world?
