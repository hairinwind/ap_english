Sir, believe me, to conduct the Government of this
country is a most arduous duty; I may say it without
irreverence, that these ancient institutions, like our
Line physical frames, are “fearfully and wonderfully
(5) made.” It is no easy task to ensure the united action
of an ancient monarchy, a proud aristocracy, and
a reformed constituency. I have done everything I
could do, and have thought it consistent with true
Conservative policy to reconcile these three branches
(10) of the State. Ihave thought it consistent with true
Conservative policy to promote so much of happiness
and contentment among the people that the voice
of disaffection should be no longer heard, and that
thoughts of the dissolution of our institutions should
(15) be forgotten in the midst of physical enjoyment.
These were my attempts, and I thought them not
inconsistent with true and enlarged Conservative
policy. These were my objects in accepting office—it
isa burden too great for my physical, and far beyond
(20) my intellectual structure; and to be relieved from it
with perfect honour would be the greatest favour that
could be conferred on me. But as a feeling of honour
and strong sense of duty require me to undertake those
responsible functions, I declare, Sir, that lam ready to
(25) incur these risks, to bear these burdens, and to front
all these honourable dangers. But, Sir, I will not take
the step with mutilated power and shackled authority.
Iwill not stand at the helm during, such tempestuous
nights as I have seen, if the vessel be not allowed fairly
(30) to pursue the course which I think she ought to take. I
will not, Sir, undertake to direct the course of the vessel
by the observations which have been taken in 1842. 1
will reserve to myself the marking out of that course;
and I must, for the public interest, claim for myself the
(35) unfettered power of judging of those measures which
conceive will be better for the country to propose.
Sir, I do not wish to be the Minister of England; but
while I have the high honour of holding that Office,
Iam determined to hold it by no servile tenure. I
(40) will only hold that office upon the condition of being
unshackled by any other obligations than those of
consulting the public interests, and of providing for the
public safety.
From British Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel's speech about the
repeal of the Corn Laws (1846)
