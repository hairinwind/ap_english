it can be demonstrated quite satisfactorily that
although Romanticism does not erupt into painting
until the very end of the eighteenth century it is
Line comparatively untrammeled in literature long before
(5) this date. One might remember in this connection
not necessarily Jean-Jacques Rousseau, often invoked
almost automatically as the patron saint of the
movement, but a novelist like the Abbé Prévost,
who, in the 1730s and 1740s, writes novels with a
(10) full repertory of Gothic effects, such as crépe-hung
mortuary chambers and doomed travelers who insist
on telling their life stories to their hapless neighbours
in stage-coaches. Even more relevant than the
novelists are a number of dramatists who accomplish a
(15) revolution in theatrical behaviour which is of singular
importance for the morphology of Romanticism.
Nivelle de la Chausée, Diderot, and their numerous
and more obscure followers create a type of dramatic
genre which calls for the actors to go out of their way
(20) to give gratuitous demonstrations of the intensity with
which they feel. For a long time these demonstrations
were confined to tragic-comedies, or comédies
Jarmoyantes, in which the gesticulating characters, often
morbid, always extravagant, were united at curtain fall,
(25) but when they were transposed to a form of tragedy,
dealing with contemporary problems, as they were in
the works of the pre-Revolutionary dramatist Louis-
Sébastien Mercier, one is already very close to the more
rhetorical aspect of Romantic paintings.
