But is it upon the heroines that we would cast
a final glance. “I have always been finding out my
religion since I was a little girl,” says Dorothea

Line Casaubon. “I used to pray so much—now I hardly ever

(5) pray. I try not to have desires merely for myself...”
She is speaking for them all. That is their problem.
They cannot live without religion, and they start out
on the search for one when they are little girls. Each
has the deep feminine passion for goodness, which
(10) makes the place where she stands in aspiration and
agony the heart of the book—still and cloistered like
a place of worship, but that she no longer knows to
whom to pray. In learning they seek their goal; in the
ordinary tasks of womanhood; in the wider service of
(15) their kind. They do not find what they seek, and we
cannot wonder. The ancient consciousness of woman,
charged with suffering and sensibility, and for so
many ages dumb, seems in them to have brimmed and
overflowed and uttered a demand for something—they
(20) scarcely know what—for something that is perhaps
incompatible with the facts of human existence. George
Eliot had far too strong an intelligence to tamper with
those facts, and too broad a humour to mitigate the
truth because it was a stern one. Save for the supreme

(25) courage of their endeavour, the struggle ends, for her
heroines, in tragedy, or in a compromise that is even
more melancholy. But their story is the incomplete
version of the story that is George Eliot herself. For her,
too, the burden and the complexity of womanhood
(30) were not enough; she must reach beyond the sanctuary
and pluck for herself the strange bright fruits of art
and knowledge. Clasping them as few women have
ever clasped them, she would not renounce her own
inheritance—the difference of view, the difference
(35) of standard—nor accept an inappropriate reward.
Thus we behold her, a memorable figure, inordinately

praised and shrinking from her fame, despondent,

reserved, shuddering back into the arms of love

as if there alone were satisfaction and, it might be,
(40) justification, at the same time reaching out with “a
fastidious yet hungry ambition” for all that life could
offer the free and inquiring mind and confronting
her feminine aspirations with the real world of men.
Triumphant was the issue for her, whatever it may
(45) have been for her creations, and as we recollect all
that she dared and achieved, how with every obstacle
against her—sex and health and convention—she
sought more knowledge and more freedom till the
body, weighted with its double burden, sank worn out,
(50) we must lay upon her grave whatever we have it in our
power to bestow of laurel and rose.
