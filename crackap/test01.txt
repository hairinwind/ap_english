There only remains one hundred and twenty
thousand children of poor parents annually born. The
question therefore is, how this number shall be reared
and provided for, which, as I have already said, under
the present situation of affairs, is utterly impossible by
all the methods hitherto proposed. For we can neither
employ them in handicraft or agriculture; we neither
build houses (I mean in the country) nor cultivate land:
they can very seldom pick up a livelihood by stealing,
till they arrive at six years old, except where they are
of towardly parts, although I confess they learn the
rudiments much earlier, during which time, they can
however be properly looked upon only as probationers,
as I have been informed by a principal gentleman in
the county of Cavan, who protested to me that he never
knew above one or two instances under the age of six,
even in a part of the kingdom so renowned for the
quickest proficiency in that art.
I am assured by our merchants, that a boy or a
girl before twelve years old is no salable commodity;
and even when they come to this age they will not
yield above three pounds, or three pounds and half-a-
crown at most on the exchange; which cannot turn to
account either to the parents or kingdom, the charge of
nutriment and rags having been at least four times that
value.
I shall now therefore humbly propose my own
thoughts, which I hope will not be liable to the least
objection.
I have been assured by a very knowing American
of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy
child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious,
nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed,
roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it
will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout.
I do therefore humbly offer it to public
consideration that of the hundred and twenty thousand
children already computed, twenty thousand may be
reserved for breed, whereof only one-fourth part to
be males; which is more than we allow to sheep, black
cattle or swine; and my reason is, that these children
are seldom the fruits of marriage, a circumstance not
much regarded by our savages, therefore one male will
be sufficient to serve four females. That the remaining
hundred thousand may, at a year old, be offered in
the sale to the persons of quality and fortune through
the kingdom; always advising the mother to let them
suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render them
plump and fat for a good table. A child will make two
dishes at an entertainment for friends; and when the
family dines alone, the fore or hind quarter will make
a reasonable dish, and seasoned with a little pepper
or salt will be very good boiled on the fourth day,
especially in winter.
I have reckoned upon a medium that a child just
born will weigh 12 pounds, and in a solar year, if
tolerably nursed, increaseth to 28 pounds.
I grant this food will be somewhat dear, and
therefore very proper for landlords, who, as they have
already devoured most of the parents, seem to have the
best title to the children.
