But it is important to keep in mind that the
engineering of learning is very often puffed up,
assigned an importance it does not deserve. As an old
Line saying goes, There are one and twenty ways to sing tribal
(5) lays, and all of them are correct. So it is with learning.
There is no one who can say that this or that is the best
way to know things, to feel things, to see things, to
remember things, to apply things, to connect things
and that no other will do as well. In fact, to make
(70) such a claim is to trivialize learning, to reduce it toa
mechanical skill.
Of course, there are many learnings that are little
else but a mechanical skill, and in such cases, there
well may be a best way. But to become a different
(15) person because of something you have learned—to
appropriate an insight, a concept, a vision, so that
your world is altered—that is a different matter. For
that to happen, you need a reason. And this is the
metaphysical problem I speak of.
(20) A reason, as 1 use the word here, is different from a
motivation. Within the context of schooling, motivation
refers to a temporary psychic event in which curiosity
is aroused and attention is focused. I do not mean to
disparage it. But it must not be confused with a reason
(25) for being in a classroom, for listening to a teacher,
for taking an examination, for doing homework, for
putting up with school even if you are not motivated.
This kind of reason is somewhat abstract, not
always present in one’s consciousness, not at all easy to
(30) describe. And yet for all that, without it schooling does
not work. For school to make sense, the young, their
parents, and their teachers must have a god to serve,
or, even better, several gods. If they have none, school
is pointless. Nietzsche's famous aphorism is relevant
(35) here: “He who has a wity to live can bear with almost
any how.” This applies as much to learning as to living.
To put it simply, there is no surer way to bring an
end to schooling than for it to have no end.
