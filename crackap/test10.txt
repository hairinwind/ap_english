it will be readily admitted, that a population
trained in regular habits of temperance, industry, and
sobriety; of genuine charity for the opinions of all
Line mankind, founded on the only knowledge that can
(5) implant true charity in the breast of any human being:
trained also in a sincere desire to do good to the utmost

of their power, and without any exception, to every

one of their fellow creatures, cannot, even by their

example alone, do otherwise than materially increase
(10) the welfare and advantages of the neighbourhood
in which such a population may be situated. To feel
the due weight of this consideration, only imagine
to yourselves 2,000 or 3,000 human beings trained
in habits of licentiousness, and allowed to remain in
(15) gross ignorance. How much, in such a case, would
not the peace, quiet, comfort, and happiness of the

neighbourhood be destroyed! But there is not anything

Thave done, or purpose to do, which is not intended

to benefit my fellow-creatures to the greatest extent
(20) that my operations can embrace. I wish to benefit all
equally; but circumstances limit my present measures
for the public good within a narrow circle. I must begin
toact at some point; and a combination of singular
events has fixed that point at this establishment. The
(25) first and greatest advantages will therefore centre here.
But, in unison with the principle thus stated, it has
ever been my intention that as this Institution, when
completed, will accommodate more than the children
of parents resident at the village, any persons living
(30) at Lanark, or in the neighbourhood anywhere around,
who cannot well afford to educate their children, shall
be at liberty, on mentioning their wishes, to send them
to this place, where they will experience the same care
and attention as those who belong to the establishment.
(35) Nor will there be any distinction made between the
children of those parents who are deemed the worst,
and of those who may be esteemed the best, members
of society: rather, indeed, would I prefer to receive the
offspring of the worst, if they shall be sent at an early
(40) age; because they really require more of our care and
pity; and by well training these, society will be more.
essentially benefited, than if the like attention were
paid to those whose parents are educating them in
comparatively good habits. The system now preparing,
(45) and which will ultimately be brought into full practice,
is to effect a complete change in all our sentiments and

conduct towards those poor miserable creatures whom

the errors of past times have denominated the bad,

the worthless, and the wicked. A more enlarged and
(50) better knowledge of human nature will make it evident
that, in strict justice, those who apply these terms to
their fellow-men are not only the most ignorant, but
are themselves the immediate causes of more misery
in the world than those whom they call the outcasts
(55) of society. They are, therefore, correctly speaking, the
most wicked and worthless; and were they not grossly
deceived, and rendered blind from infancy, they
would become conscious of the lamentably extensive
evils, which, by their well-intended but most mistaken
(60) conduct, they have, during so long a period, inflicted
‘on their fellow-men. But the veil of darkness must be
removed from their eyes; their erroneous proceedings
must be made so palpable that they shall thenceforth
reject them with horror. Yes! They will reject with
(65) horror even those notions which hitherto they have
from infancy been taught to value beyond price.
