The most obvious joke in the title of Swift's Travels
into Several Remote Nations of the World is that what
purports to be a chronicle of several excursions to
Line remote nations turns out to be a satiric anatomy of
(5) specifically English attitudes and values. But there
is a second joke. Many of the supposedly unfamiliar
and exotic sights Gulliver sees in his sixteen years and
seven months of wandering in remote nations, and
even the radically altered perspectives from which he
(10) Sees them (as diminutive landscapes, giant people,
intelligent animals, etc.), could have been seen or
experienced in a few days by anyone at the tourists
sights, public entertainments, shows, spectacles, and
exhibitions in the streets and at the fairs of London.
(15) It isnot surprising that Gulliver's Travels should
be filled with the shows and diversions of London.
All the Scriblerians were fascinated with popular
entertainments; collectively and individually, they
satirized them in many of their works. Swift shared
(20) this fascination with his fellow Scriblerians, and he
transforms the sights and shows of London into an
imaginative center of Gulliver's Travels.
Gulliver himself senses that the wonders he sees
in remote nations resemble popular entertainments
(25) back home in England when he notes that the capital
city of Lilliput “looked like the painted Scene of a
City in a Theatre.”" And other popular entertainments
would allow Londoners to see many of the same sights
Gulliver saw in Lilliput. A Londoner could experience
(30) what a miniature city looked like to the giant Gulliver
by going to see the papier-maché and clay architectural
and topographical models displayed at fairs and in
inns, some of which were extraordinarily elaborate and
detailed, such as the model of Amsterdam exhibited
(35) in 1710, which was twenty feet wide and twenty to
thirty feet long, “with all the Churches, Chappels,
Stadt house, Hospitals, noble Buildings, Streets, Trees,
Walks, Avenues, with the Sea, Shipping, Sluices,
Rivers, Canals &c., most exactly built to admiration.”*
(40) — Miniature people, as well as miniature landscapes,
could be seen in one of the most popular diversions in
London, the peepshows, which were enclosed boxes
containing scenes made out of painted board, paper
flats, and glass panels and given the illusion of depth
(45) by mirrors and magnifying glasses. All of this was
seen through a hole bored in one side. Among the
most popular scenes were interiors, particularly palace
interiors of European royalty, and so there is a direct
analogy between peering in the hole of a peepshow
(50) and Gulliver's looking into the palace in Lilliput: “I
applied my Face to the Windows of the middle Stories,
and discovered the most splendid Apartments that
can be imagined. There I saw the Empress, and the
young Princes in their several Lodgings. Her Imperial
(55) Majesty was pleased to smile very graciously upon
me, and gave me out the window her Hand to kiss.”
The queen’s movements could have been seen in the
peepshows, too, for clockwork animating the figures
was introduced early in the century. And much the
(60) same illusion of a living, miniature world could be
found in another popular diversion, the “moving
picture,” a device in which cutout figures were placed
within a frame and activated by jacks and wheels. This
curiosity fascinated contemporary Londoners: “The
(65) landscape looks as an ordinary picture till the clock-
work behind the curtain be set at work, and then the
ships move and sail distinctly upon the sea till out of
sight; a coach comes out of town, the motion of the
horses and wheels are very distinct, and a gentleman in
(70) the coach that salutes the company; a hunter also and
his dogs keep their course till out of sight.” Swift saw
this same moving picture, or one very much like it, and
was impressed
