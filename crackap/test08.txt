His exuberance of knowledge, and plenitude of
ideas, sometimes obstruct the tendency of his reasoning
and the clearness of his decisions: on whatever subject

Line he employed his mind, there started up immediately so

(5) many images before him, that he lost one by grasping
another. His memory supplied him with so many

illustrations, parallel or dependent notions, that he was

always starting into collateral considerations; but the

spirit and vigour of his pursuit always gives delight;
(10) and the reader follows him, without reluctance,
through his mazes, in themselves flowery and pleasing,
and ending at the point originally in view.
“To have great excellencies and great faults,
‘magnee virtutes nec minora vitia is the poesy,” says
(15) our author, “of the best natures.” This poesy may be
properly applied to the style of Browne; it is vigorous,
but rugged; itis learned, but pedantick; itis deep, but
obscure; it strikes, but does not please; it commands,
but does not allure; his tropes are harsh, and his,

(20) combinations uncouth.
He fell into an age in which our language began
to lose the stability which it had obtained in the time
of Elizabeth; and was considered by every writer as
a subject on which he might try his plastick skill, by

(25) moulding it according to his own fancy. Milton, in
consequence of this encroaching license, began to
introduce the Latin idiom: and Browne, though he
gave less disturbance to our structures in phraseology,
yet poured in a multitude of exotick words; many,
(30) indeed, useful and significant, which, if rejected, must
be supplied by circumlocution, such as commensality,
for the state of many living at the same table; but many
superfluous, as a paralogical, for an unreasonable
doubt; and some so obscure, that they conceal his

(35) meaning rather than explain it, as arthritical analogies,
for parts that serve some animals in the place of joints.
His style is, indeed, a tissue of many languages;
a mixture of heterogeneous words, brought
together from distant regions, with terms originally
(40) appropriated to one art, and drawn by violence into
the service of another. He must, however, be confessed
to have augmented our philosophical diction; and, in
defence of his uncommon words and expressions, we
must consider, that he had uncommon sentiments, and
(45) was not content to express, in many words, that idea
for which any language could supply a single term.
But his innovations are sometimes pleasing, and
his temerities happy: he has many “verba ardentia”
forcible expressions, which he would never have
(50) found, but by venturing to the utmost verge of
propriety; and flights which would never have been
reached, but by one who had very little fear of the
shame of falling.
