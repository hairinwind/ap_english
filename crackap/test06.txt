It is one thing for railroad carriers to furnish, or to
be required by law to furnish, equal accommodations
for all whom they are under a legal duty to carry.
Line Itis quite another thing for government to forbid
(5) citizens of the white and black races from traveling
in the same public conveyance, and to punish officers
of railroad companies for permitting persons of the
two races to occupy the same passenger coach. If a
state can prescribe, as a rule of civil conduct, that
(10) whites and blacks shall not travel as passengers in the
same railroad coach, why may it not so regulate the
use of the streets of its cities and towns as to compel
white citizens to keep on one side of a street, and
black citizens to keep on the other? Why may it not,
(15) upon like grounds, punish whites and blacks who
Tide together in street cars or in open vehicles on a
public road or street? Why may it not require sheriffs
to assign whites to one side of a court room, and
blacks to the other? And why may it not also prohibit
(20) the commingling of the two races in the galleries of
legislative halls or in public assemblages convened for
the consideration of the political questions of the day?
Further, if this statute of Louisiana is consistent with
the personal liberty of citizens, why may not the state
(25) require the separation in railroad coaches of native
and naturalized citizens of the United States, or of
Protestants and Roman Catholics?
The white race deems itself to be the dominant
race in this country. And so itis, in prestige, in
(30) achievements, in education, in wealth, and in power.
So, I doubt not, it will continue to be for all time, if
it remains true to its great heritage, and holds fast to
the principles of constitutional liberty. But in view of
the constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this
(35) country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens.
 There is no caste here. Our constitution is color-blind,
and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens
In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before
the law. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful.
(40) The law regards man as man, and takes no account
of his surroundings or of his color when his civil
rights as guarantied by the supreme law of the land
are involved. It is therefore to be regretted that this
high tribunal, the final expositor of the fundamental
(45) law of the land, has reached the conclusion that it is
competent for a state to regulate the enjoyment by
citizens of their civil rights solely upon the basis of
race,
In my opinion, the judgment this day rendered will,
(50) in time, prove to be quite as pernicious as the decision
made by this tribunal in the Dred Scott Case.
It was adjudged in that case that the descendants
of Africans who were imported into this country, and
sold as slaves, were not included nor intended to be
(55) included under the word  citizens  in the constitution,
and could not claim any of the rights and privileges
which that instrument provided for and secured to
citizens of the United States; that, at the time of the
adoption of the constitution, they were  considered
(60) as.a subordinate and inferior class of beings, who had
been subjugated by the dominant race, and, whether
emancipated or not, yet remained subject to their
authority, and had no rights or privileges but such as
those who held the power and the government might
(65) choose to grant them.  The recent amendments of the
constitution, it was supposed, had eradicated these
principles from our institutions.
Tam of opinion that the state of Louisiana is
inconsistent with the personal liberty of citizens, white
(70) and black, in that state, and hostile to both the spirit
and letter of the constitution of the United States.
If laws of like character should be enacted in the
several states of the Union, the effect would be in the
highest degree mischievous. Slavery, as an institution
(75) tolerated by law, would, it is true, have disappeared
from our country; but there would remain a power in
the states, by sinister legislation, to interfere with the
full enjoyment of the blessings of freedom, to regulate
civil rights, common to all citizens, upon the basis of
(80) race, and to place in a condition of legal inferiority a
large body of American citizens, now constituting a
part of the political community, called the "People of
the United States," for whom, and by whom through
representatives, our government is administered.
(85) Such a system is inconsistent with the guaranty
given by the constitution to each state of a republican
form of government, and may be stricken down by
congressional action, or by the courts in the discharge
of their solemn duty to maintain the supreme law of
(90) the land, anything in the constitution or laws of any
state to the contrary notwithstanding.
For the reason stated, Iam constrained to withhold
my assent from the opinion and judgment of the
majority.
