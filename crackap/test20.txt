Gary infuriated his fiancée, Ellen, because even though he was intelligent, thoughtful,
and a successful surgeon, Gary was emotionally flat, completely unresponsive
to any and all shows of feeling. While Gary could speak brilliantly of science and art,
when it came to his feelings-even for Ellen-he fell silent. Try as she might to elicit
(5) some passion from him, Gary was impassive, oblivious. "I don't naturally express my
feelings," Gary told the therapist he saw at Ellen's insistence. When it came to emotional
life, he added, "I don't know what to talk about; I have no strong feelings, either positive or negative."
Ellen was not alone in being frustrated by Gary's aloofness; as he confided to his
(10) therapist, he was unable to speak openly about his feelings with anyone in his life.
The reason: He did not know what he felt in the first place. So far as he could tell he
had no angers, no sadness, no joys.1
As his own therapist observes, this emotional blankness makes Gary and others like
him colorless, bland: "They bore everybody. That's why their wives send them into
(15) treatment." Gary's emotional flatness exemplifies what psychiatrists call alexithymia,
from the Greek a for "lack," lexis for "word," and thymos for "emotion." Such people
lack words for their feelings. Indeed, they seem to lack feelings altogether, although
this may actually be because of their inability to express emotion rather than from an
absence of emotion altogether. Such people were first noticed by psychoanalysts puzzled
(20) by a class of patients who were untreatable by that method because they reported
no feelings, no fantasies, and colorless dreams-in short, no inner emotional life to
talk about at all.2 The clinical features that mark alexithymics include having difficulty
describing feelings-their own or anyone else's-and a sharply limited emotional
vocabulary.3 What's more, they have trouble discriminating among emotions as well
(25) as between emotions and bodily sensation, so that they might tell of having butterflies
in the stomach, palpitations, sweating, and dizziness-but they would not know they
are feeling anxious.
"They give the impression of being different, alien beings, having come from an
entirely different world, living in the midst of a society which is dominated by feelings,"
(30) is the description given by Dr. Peter Sifneos, the Harvard psychiatrist who
in 1972 coined the term alexithymia.4 Alexithymics rarely cry, for example, but if
they do their tears are copious. Still, they are bewildered if asked what the tears
are all about. One patient with alexithymia was so upset after seeing a movie about
a woman with eight children who was dying of cancer that she cried herself to
(35) sleep. When her therapist suggested that perhaps she was upset because the movie
reminded her of her own mother, who was in actuality dying of cancer, the woman
sat motionless, bewildered, and silent. When her therapist then asked her how she
felt at that moment, she said she felt "awful," but couldn't clarify her feelings beyond
that. And, she added, from time to time she found herself crying, but never knew
(40) exactly what she was crying about.
