The history of music until about 200 A.D. is shrouded in darkness because there is 
virtually no extant music and little was written about it by the ancients. (2) The 
journey that jazz has taken can be traced with reasonable accuracy. (3) That it 
ripened most fully in New Orleans seems beyond dispute, although there are a few 
misguided deviants who support other theories of its origin. (4) Even before jazz, for 
most New Orleanians, music wasn't a luxury as it often is elsewhere. (5) It was a 
necessity. (6) Throughout the nineteenth century, diverse ethnic and racial groups—
French, Spanish, and African, Italian, German, and Irish—found common cause in 
their love of music. (7) European folk and African-Caribbean elements merged with a 
popular American mainstream, causing a cultural revolution that spread far and wide. 
(8) Just after the beginning of the new century, jazz began to emerge as part of a 
broad musical revolution. (9) It encompassed ragtime, blues, spirituals, marches, and 
the popular fare of "Tin Pan Alley." (10) It also reflected the profound contributions of 
people of African heritage to this new and distinctly American music. (11) Clearly, 
the need for an audience was obvious for it to succeed. (12) Then, of course, there 
was talent for the production of it—also essential. (13) Moreover, success was 
required for there to be a favorable audience to receive and support it. (14) Before 
long, the local urge for musical expression was powerful. (15) Anything that could be 
twanged, strummed, beaten, blown, or stroked was likely to be exploited for its 
musical usefulness. (16) For a long time, the washboard was a highly respected 
percussion instrument, and the nimble fingers of Baby Dodds and others showed 
sheer genius on that workaday, washday utensil. (17) What's more, dancing had long 
been a mainstay of New Orleans nightlife, and jazz performers gave dancers what 
they wanted. (18) During earlier decades, string bands, led by violinists, had co-
managed dance work. (19) They offered waltzes, quadrilles, and polkas to a polite 
dancing public. (20) However, when jazz greats like Buddy Bolden and King Oliver 
arrived on the scene, they blew their predecessors out of the water in funeral parades. 
(21) From there, it was a small step to take their music into the dance halls and clubs 
of their uncommonly vital city. (22) The development of jazz in New Orleans was 
also connected to the community life of the early days seen in brass band funerals, 
music for picnics in parks or at ball games, Saturday fish fries, and Sunday camping 
along the shores of Lake Pontchartrain. (23) There were also red-beans-and-rice 
banquets on Mondays and nightly dances in neighborhoods all over town. (25) This 
spirit or emotional content connected the performer to the audience. (26) It offered a 
musical communication in which all parties could participate. (27) By the turn of the 
twentieth century, instrumentation borrowed from both brass marching bands and 
string bands was predominant. (28) It consisted of a front line of cornet, clarinet, and 
trombone, and with a rhythm section of guitar, bass, and drums. (29) Dance 
audiences, especially the younger ones, however, craved more excitement. (30) 
Gradually, the emergence of ragtime, blues, and, later, jazz began to satisfy the 
demand. (31) Musicians began to redefine roles, moving away from sight-reading 
toward playing by ear. (32) The 1890s represented the culmination of a century of 
music making in the city and around the country. (33) Stories of the twenties in 
Chicago and elsewhere are almost too familiar to need repeating here. (34) What 
seems pertinent is to observe that jazz gravitated toward a particular kind of 
environment in which its existence was not only possible but, seen in retrospect, 
probable. (35) On the south side of Chicago during the twenties, the New Orleans 
music continued an unbroken development. (36) It is not by coincidence that the 
decade of the 1920s has come to be known as "The Jazz Age." (37) This was the time 
when jazz became fashionable, as part of the youthful revolution in morals and 
manners that came with the “return to normalcy" following World War I. (38) 
Americans were now more urbanized, affluent, and entertainment-oriented than ever 
before. (39) The music industry was quick to take advantage of the situation. (40) In 
1921, 100 million phonograph records were produced in the United States (compared 
to 25 million in 1914). (41) Two years later, production remained high at 92 million, 
setting a trend which continued for the better part of the decade (until the impact of 
radio). (42) This prosperity relied heavily on the demand for records for dancers. (43) 
They could be used at home for practicing the latest steps, including such exotic 
dances as the Shimmy, the Charleston, and the more utilitarian Fox Trot, also known 
as "the businessman's bounce."
